```bash
npm run status
```
View current system status and metrics.

#### 5. Generate Reports
```bash
npm run report
```
Generate comprehensive development reports.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Foundation
- DevOps team sets up cloud infrastructure
- Quality team establishes testing framework
- Duration: ~2-3 minutes

### Phase 2: Core Development
- Frontend, Backend, and Domain teams work in parallel
- All core features implemented
- Duration: ~5-7 minutes

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- Cross-team integration validation
- Comprehensive testing execution
- Duration: ~2-3 minutes

### Phase 4: Optimization & Polish
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinement
- Security hardening
- Duration: ~2-3 minutes

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
- Production build generation
- Final validation
- Deployment package creation
- Duration: ~1-2 minutes

## Quality Gates

The system enforces strict quality gates:

- **Test Coverage**: ≥95%
- **Performance**: 100/100 Lighthouse score
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance
- **Security**: Zero vulnerabilities
- **Crisis Response**: <200ms
- **Load Time**: <1 second globally

## Integration Points

Key integration checkpoints between teams:

1. **API Contract Definition** (Frontend ↔ Backend)
2. **Database Schema Integration** (Backend ↔ Domain)
3. **UI Component Library** (Frontend ↔ Domain)
4. **Security Implementation** (Backend ↔ DevOps)
5. **Testing Framework Setup** (Quality ↔ All Teams)
6. **CI/CD Pipeline** (DevOps ↔ Quality)
7. **Monitoring & Analytics** (DevOps ↔ Backend ↔ Domain)
8. **Crisis Response System** (Domain ↔ Frontend ↔ Backend)

## Success Metrics

Upon successful execution, the system delivers:

- ✅ All CoreV2 features reimplemented with improvements
- ✅ Performance exceeding CoreV2 benchmarks
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage
- ✅ WCAG AAA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Sub-second load times globally
- ✅ Crisis response <200ms
- ✅ HIPAA & GDPR compliant

## Monitoring & Debugging

### View Real-time Logs
```bash
tail -f logs/execution.log
```

### Debug Specific Agent
```bash
DEBUG=agent:* npm start
```

### Performance Profiling
```bash
npm run profile
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Agent Configuration
Edit `agent-coordinator.ts` to modify agent behaviors and dependencies.

### Parallel Execution Tuning
Adjust batch sizes and timing in `orchestrator.ts`:

```typescript
const batches = this.groupIntoBatches(executionOrder);
// Modify stagger timing
batches.forEach((batch, index) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.executeBatch(batch, index);
  }, index * 100); // Adjust timing here
});
```

### Quality Gate Customization
Modify thresholds in `agent-coordinator.ts`:

```typescript
criteria: [
  { metric: 'Lighthouse Score', threshold: 100 }, // Adjust threshold
  { metric: 'Test Coverage', threshold: 95 }      // Adjust threshold
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Timeout**
   - Increase timeout in agent implementation
   - Check for blocking dependencies

2. **Integration Failure**
   - Verify all dependent teams completed
   - Check integration point validation

3. **Quality Gate Failure**
   - Review specific metric that failed
   - Run targeted optimization for that area

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce parallel execution batch size
   - Enable swap space for large operations

## Contributing
